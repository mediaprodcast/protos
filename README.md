**Concept:**

The "protos" repository houses shared protocol buffer definitions used for inter-service communication.

**Contents:**

* **Protocol Buffer Definitions (.proto files):**
    * **Service Definitions:** Define gRPC services with their request and response messages.
    * **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Define common data structures used for exchanging data between services (e.g., user data, media metadata, job requests).
    * **Enums:** Define shared enumerations for common values (e.g., job status, encoding presets).
